# Mileage-Tracker

This project contains a few different files the first file Mileage.py is the main code for the project, the next file run_gui.py is used to run the file on a windows machine without needing the command prompt. Finally to pull it all together is the run_gui.bat which is the bat file that can be added to a desktop and clicked for a simple way to run the program.
